We developed four versions of this transformation filter:

Manual filter design – Based on a visual comparison of the frequency responses of bone- and air-conduction signals.
Using a combination of band-pass and low-pass filters, we achieved good results both in listening tests and in matching the target frequency curve.

2–4. VibVoice-inspired approaches – Following ideas from VibVoice, we implemented three alternatives:

an Otsu-based filtering method (as in the original VibVoice work),

a triangle-filtering method, and

a spectrogram-difference method, which models the difference between bone and air spectrograms.

Ultimately, we retained only the Otsu-based filter and the manually designed filter as our synthetic bone-conduction generators.
